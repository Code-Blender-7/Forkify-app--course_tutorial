This log is about the final project of the JavaScript Development Course.

# START

This is it. the end of my first javascript course. well, not really. After this project, I be moving on from the course. I pirated it from the internet so I won't be getting a certificate at my resume. That is indeed a sad news. But hey! I have started this journey a long time ago and it is on its last leg.

I seen a lot of new growth over my years in the course. I just wanted to finish it before the start of a new year. Then, perhaps that I just let the people know that I pirated this course. Not for the job ofc. I did it because I wanted to create my own website and research with the community. 

there is a lot to be worked at in this course ofc. Maybe I just buy the real course when I have the money and accept the certificate with grace. haha. Lol I am being emotional here.


### Moving from ST4 to VS Code

the shifting of the ST4 to VS code is not that easy. But i gotta make that do as well. After all, I be working with the pros now. The github addons are completed and the project is ready for ops.

ST3-ST4 was a big help to me. It helped me to code when I had a poor system performance. Today, I have upgraded my laptop specs to ensure that I could keep up with the industry standards. I love you Sublime Text Editor. Thanks for all the years. <3

### Measures to project the API key

the api key of the forkify app is protected by nothing. If someone finds the link, they can easily reverse it and get their own API key from the website. The website is currently maintained by Jonas. If the website overloads, then we are doomed and the whole project will be a FUBAR. For that, the link is exported from other file called the ```auth.js```. It will return a link to access the information of the website.

This is the beginning of the final project of this course. The forkify app. A app that requires JavaScript to operate a website that is used to display the recipe of many cookings including servings etc. by getting the info from a API website.
